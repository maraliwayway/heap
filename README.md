# Min-Heap Implementation in C++

This project provides a robust implementation of a generic Min-Heap class (HeapT) in C++, designed to efficiently manage data with operations such as insertion, removal, merging, and retrieval. Additionally, it includes a function largestm to identify the m largest elements in a vector using the custom heap.
